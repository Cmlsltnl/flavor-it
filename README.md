# FLAVOR IT
![FLAVOR-IT Demo](/public/images/readme-img.png?raw=true "FLAVOR-IT Demo")
A web app to promote recipe-sharing and foodiesâ€™ community. 

One of the main priorities of this project is to help users manage their recipes in a more organised way, to do so this platform allows users to publish their favourite recipes and save other users' recipes by the like function.  

Another main priority of this project is to help users to connect with other foodies. To achieve that, it allows users to follow other users by the following function and exchange cooking tips / experience by the recipe commenting function. 

You may use our demonstration account to look around on [our deployment page](https://flavor-it.herokuapp.com/).
